# Math Competiton

Since this year’s theme of EduHack is education, our team chose to battle the one problem that frustrates kids the most: math.

This application we will present is made to solve the problem of kids disliking math. Our application makes math educational, yet fun at the same time.

According to a survey conducted by the Texas Instrumental Company, 46% of students enjoy math, 24% dislike math, and 30% are in the middle.

Almost a quarter of students dislike math! That percentage is way too high! One of the main reasons why kids hate math is because it’s just not fun, according to Oxford Learning.

This is our problem that we are trying to solve: too many kids dislike math because it is just not fun.
We have created an application to solve this problem. This application has a fun leveling system - when a student answers a math question correctly, they go up a level. This incentives kids to get the question correct to try to get to a the highest level they possibly can! And with each question they get correctly, they also receive a few points! This makes math educational, yet fun at the same time.

Brief overview of the application: the application starts on a homepage, waiting for the user to click start. The user is brought to a new page where they can choose what level of math they would like to do - 1st-12th grade. Subsequently, the user is asked to answer a math question for that level of math they chose. If they get the question correct, they go up a level, if they get the question wrong, they lose and are prompted to return to the homescreen where they can play again. The user will also gets more points for every question they answer correctly. These points will be saved in the localStorage, meaning that their points will remain the same even if they close the tab or refresh the page. This gives an incentive for students to answer questions correctly to earn more points!

This project was created using three programming languages, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

We also used VSCode, GitHub, and Glitch to run and test our code.

What's next: As expected, we were not able to finish everything we desired to create in our application. After this hackathon is over, some of our plans on further developing our application is as follows: We will add more types of problems - it is evident that students will soon master the types of problems given in our program, meaning we have to give them new problems to further challenge them. Secondly, we also plan to further develop the point/xp system. Yes, the system already provides a lot of incentive to get math questions correct, but we plan to add a shop where students can buy collectables using their points. We plan to also add more customization for the user’s game. Such as background image, avatars, etc.
